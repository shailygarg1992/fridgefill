## Bugs found and fixed

| Bug | How user saw it | Root cause | Fix |
|-----|----------------|------------|-----|
| Photo upload crashes | "Request Entity Too Large" error | iPhone photos are 3-12MB, Vercel limits requests to 4.5MB | Compress images client-side to under 300KB before sending |
| Empty image error | "image cannot be empty" from Claude API | Image loading race condition — code sent data before image finished loading | Changed to `createImageBitmap` which handles the file directly |
| Image format error | "Failed to compress image" | iPhone uses HEIC format which canvas couldn't process | `createImageBitmap` handles HEIC natively on iOS |
| Cancel button unreachable | Button hidden under iPhone clock | No padding for iOS status bar safe area | Added top padding to push below status bar |
| No photo upload option | Only camera capture available | Single file input with `capture` attribute | Added separate Camera and Upload buttons |
| Done/Back buttons hidden | Results & Staples screen buttons under iPhone clock | Same safe area issue, missed on 2 screens | Added `pt-14` padding to both screen headers |
| Cart total inflated | 3 items at $1-$3 each showing $52 total | Claude returned ambiguous `est_price` (sometimes per-unit, sometimes total), code multiplied by qty again | Renamed to `unit_price` with explicit prompt rules, added price breakdown display |

## What was descoped from the PRD for MVP

- **Collapsible sections** (Need Now / Need Soon / Don't Forget) — replaced with a single flat list
- All Phase 2 and 3 features remain for later
